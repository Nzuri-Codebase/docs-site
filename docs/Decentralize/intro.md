# Introduction
This is the documentation that outlines the usage of the Nzuri Decentralize Web App and the mathematical logic used in the computation of the various services.

## Important information
**Note** :The web app is scheduled to be turned on every Friday at 0700hrs GMT+3 and off every Friday at 1800hrs GMT+3 (this is due to cost optimization). In case a user needs access on any other time besides the scheduled up-time, feel free to contact Teofilo Gafna via Microsoft Teams.
The app takes about 4 - 5 minutes to fully wake up but once it is up there is very minimal latency during usage.

## Landing page
Upon clicking the link to the app, you will be directed to a page where you will be asked to login using your Nzuri email address, any other email address will be denied access by the backend authentification process.
For a user to login in:
* insert your Nzuri email.
* click the login button **twice**.

Once you have been logged in, the user has access to the currently available services for the Honda and Nissan accounts. The steps to use the app are very simple and self explanatory.
